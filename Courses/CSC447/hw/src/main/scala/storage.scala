/* INSTRUCTIONS
 *
 * Complete the exercises below.  For each "EXERCISE" comment, add code
 * immediately below the comment.
 *
 * Please see README.md for instructions, including compilation and testing.
 *
 * GRADING
 *
 * 1. Submissions MUST compile using SBT with UNCHANGED configuration and
 *    tests with no compilation errors.  Submissions with compilation errors
 *    will receive 0 points.  Note that refactoring the code will cause the
 *    tests to fail.
 *
 * 2. You MUST NOT edit the SBT configuration and tests.  Altering it in your
 *    submission will result in 0 points for this assignment.
 *
 * 3. You MAY use (re)assignment to variables and "val" and "var"
 *    declarations (you will have to).
 *
 * 4. In all of the exercises in this file, you can only add code between the
 *    existing "{...}" for the val/def.  That is, you cannot add a new
 *    val/def directly inside the "storage" object.
 *
 * SUBMISSION
 *
 * 1. Submit this file on D2L before the deadline.
 *
 * 2. Late submissions will not be permitted because solutions will be
 *    discussed in class.

  // EXERCISE 1: Complete the following definition, so that "constant5" is a
  // function that returns 5 whenever it is invoked.
  val constant5: () => Int = 
      // TODO: Complete the definition.
      () => 5 //=> throw UnsupportedOperationException()

  // EXERCISE 2: Complete the following definition, so that "constant" is a
  // function that when invoked with integer n returns a function that
  // returns n whenever it is invoked.
  val constant: Int => () => Int = {
        // TODO: Complete the definition.
        (n: Int) => (()=>n)//=> throw UnsupportedOperationException()
  }
  // EXERCISE 3: Complete the following definition, so that "counter0" is a
  // (stateful) function that returns 0 when it is first invoked, then 1,
  // then 2, etc.
  //
  // REMEMBER: you can use "var" but everything you add has to be inside the
  // "{...}" body of "counter0".

  // This rule applies throughout this assignment.
  val counter0: () => Int = {
    // TODO: Complete the definition.
     var n = -1
     () => { n = n+1 ; n}//=> throw UnsupportedOperationException()
  }

  // EXERCISE 4: Complete the following definition, so that "counter" is a
  // (stateless) function that when invoked with integer n returns a
  // (stateful) function that returns n when it is first invoked, then n+1,
  // then n+2, etc.
  //
  // The counters must be independent, i.e., running "counter (0)" twice
  // should yield two functions that do not interfere with one another's
  // state.
  val counter: Int => () => Int = 
    (n: Int) => {
       var x = n-1
       () =>
         {
           x = x+1
           x
         }
    }
    // TODO: Complete the definition.
    //throw UnsupportedOperationException()

  // EXERCISE 5: Complete the following definition, so that "getAndSet" is a
  // (stateless) function that when invoked with integer n returns a pair of
  // functions (that share state) that allow reading and writing a var that
  // is initialized with integer n.
  //
  // The first function in the pair should be the reader.  The second
  // function in the pair should be the writer.
  //
  // For example, the following expression should return 10:
  // { val (get, set) = getAndSet (5); set (10); get () }
  //
  // Multiple calls to "getAndSet" should yield independent pairs, i.e., the
  // first pair returned should not share any state with the second pair
  // returned.
  val getAndSet: Int => (() => Int, Int => Unit) = 
    // TODO: Complete the definition.
    (n:  Int) => {
      var value = n
      def get: () => Int = () => value
      def set: Int => Unit = (e: Int) => value = e
      (get, set)
    }
    //throw UnsupportedOperationException()

  // EXERCISE 6: Complete the following definition, so that "getAndSetSpy" is
  // a (stateful) function that when invoked it returns a pair.
  //
  // The second component of the pair should behave like "getAndSet" above
  // (with the exception noted next).
  //
  // The first component of the pair is a function that, when invoked,
  // returns the total number of times that a "set" call has been made.
  //
  // That number should cover all calls to "set" made in all pairs created
  // via "getAndSetSpy".  That is, the total number is a piece of state
  // shared all "set" functions created via "getAndSetSpy".
  //
  // For example:
  // val (spy1, getAndSet1) = getAndSetSpy ()
  // val (spy2, getAndSet2) = getAndSetSpy ()
  // val (get1a, set1a) = getAndSet1 (0)
  // val (get2a, set2a) = getAndSet2 (0)
  // set1a(10)
  // set2a(20)
  // spy1()
  //   val res1: Int = 2
  //
  // The result is 2, not 1.
